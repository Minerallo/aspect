# This simple lateral pipe model tests the projected density approximation within
# the multicomponent compressible material model. Here we look at the mass flux
# difference (i.e., error) between the left (in) and right (out) boundaries to asses the
# efficacy of the pda approximation in terms of mass conservation.

# The pipe has dimensions 100x1000 km with a material influx of 1 cm per year
# at the leftmost boundary. We also apply a temperature gradient which spans 1600 K
# at the leftmost boundary to 1800 K at the rightmost.

# We ignore gravity in this model to limit the change in density to temperature and
# pressure fluctuations stemming from the temperature gradient and lateral Advection
# respectively.

# The mass flux error at the end time (2e6 years) of this test and the equivalent test using a 
# different material model in benchmarks/compressibility_formulations is as follows:
# Mass flux error corresponding to the tests/multicomponent_compressibile_projected_density_lateral_pipe_advect : 0.004840160569129433
# Mass flux error corresponding to the tests/compressibility_lateral_pipe_advect_projected_density              : 0.004871669696948347

# The small differences in the mass flux error above reflect the different compressible equations of state 
# used by each material model
