# This test defines an initial blob of porosity implaced in a solid within a 2D cartesian box.
# Because the porosity blob is less dense, the blob will rise to the surface of the model and
# flow out of the top of the box. Additionally, there is an imposed solid inflow at the top boundary,
# and so one composition will be outflowing (the porosity) while another is inflowing (the solid).
# This tests the implementation of composition dependent outflow boundary conditions when a composition 
# is advected with the fluid velocity. The composition of the 'porosity' compositional field should change 
# from its initial value along the parts of the boundary where the blob is flowing out.
