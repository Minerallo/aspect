# Finite strain benchmark

This benchmark reproduces an analytical benchmark for the evolution
of finite strain in a model of simple shear as described (for a specific
application) in McKenzie & Jackson (1983): "The relationship between
strain rates, crustal thickening, paleomagnetism, finite strain and
fault movements within a deforming zone."

Please see the parameter file for more details.
