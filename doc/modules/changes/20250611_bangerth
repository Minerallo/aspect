Changed: The MaterialModel::MaterialModelInputs and
MaterialModel::MaterialModelOutputs classes had member functions
`get_additional_input()` and `get_additional_output()` functions that
simply returned C-style pointers. The use of such pointers leaves it
entirely unclear who now owns the object pointed to. As a consequence,
these functions have now been deprecated and replaced by functions
`get_additional_input_object()` and `get_additional_output_object()`
that return their results in the form of `std::shared_ptr` values that
make clear that the calling place receiving the pointer now shares
ownership of the input or output object with the place that the object
is requested from.

The old functions have been retained for backward compatibility
purposes, but they are now deprecated.
