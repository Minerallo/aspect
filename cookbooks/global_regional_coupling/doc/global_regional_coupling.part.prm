# When applying the velocities from global convection models as boundary conditions
# on regional models, enabling an open boundary dramatically improves convergence.
# In the global convection models, mass is conserved across the entire domain, but interpolating
# onto a new grid introduces a small mass error. Opening a boundary allows the regional
# model to dynamically conserve mass based on the prescribed velocities on the other
# boundaries of the regional model. Here, we prescribe a free slip boundary on the
# surface of the model, global velocities on the four lateral boundaries, and then leave
# the basal boundary open.
