# This .prm file is intended to test the kernel density estimation
# based algorithm for deleting excess particles in 3D. The KDE-based algorithm
# generates a point-density function from the location of the particles 
# and removes the particles whose location represents the maximum of the 
# point density function first. This method is intended to avoid some of the 
# problems with particle clustering which are caused by randomly deleting
# excess particles. This test is the same as particle_KDE_deletion except in 
# 3 dimensions instead of 2.
