Changed: The prescribed dilation is now split into two parts: a
pressure-dependent part that is moved to the left-hand side of the mass
conservation equation, and a pressure-independent part that stays on the
right-hand side. In addition, the effect of dilation on the momentum
conservation equation for incompressible models is no longer represented by
the dilation term on the right-hand side, but by the volumetric strain rate
term on the left-hand side. These changes enable the Drucker-Prager model
to produce associated plastic flows, in which the shear bands develop along
the Coulomb angle.
