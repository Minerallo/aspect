## Principal developers

ASPECT is being developed by a large, collaborative, and inclusive

the documentation, helping users on the online forums and in person, and
in many other visible and invisible ways:

* Wolfgang Bangerth (Colorado State University, USA)
* Juliane Dannberg (GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research, Germany)
* Menno Fraters (University of Graz, Austria)
* Rene Gassmoeller (GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research, Germany)
* Anne Glerum (Geoforschungszentrum Potsdam, Germany)
* Timo Heister (Clemson University, USA)
* Bob Myhill (University of Bristol, UK)
* John Naliboff (New Mexico Tech, USA)
* Cedric Thieulot (Utrecht University, Netherlands)
