## This test is based off of the test: tian_peridotite.prm, and ensures that mass
## of water is being conserved when using the Reactive Fluid Transport model, with
## the Tian 2019 reaction model. The test prescribes 11% bound water in a 100% 
## peridotite composition, which has a solid density of 3000 kg/m^3, and 0% 
## initial porosity. The python code below shows to calculate the volume of free water
## after this reaction has been completed. The total mass of water in the model is given by:
# initial_wt_percent_water = 0.11 # (11%)
# initial_porosity = 0.0 # (0%)
# solid_density = 3000 # (kg/m^3)
# water_density = 1000 # (kg/m^3)
# bulk_density  = (1 - initial_porosity) * solid_density + initial_porosity * water_density # (kg/m^3)

# mass_fraction_bound_water = (1 - initial_porosity) * solid_density / bulk_density
# mass_fraction_free_water = initial_porosity * water_density / bulk_density
# total_water = wt_percent_water * mass_fraction_bound_water + mass_fraction_free_water # This needs to be conserved

# final_wt_percent_water = 0.1 # (10% wt percent of bound water in the solid, 1 wt percent of water released)
## If the mass of water is conserved, then we can use the expression for the total_water to determine what the final
## porosity should be.
## 
## DO SOME ALGEBRA..... 
## final_mass_fraction_bound_water = (1 - final_porosity) * solid_density / new_bulk_density
## final_mass_fraction_free_water = final_porosity * water_density / new_bulk_density
## Substitute in to the above equations: new_bulk_density = (1 - final_porosity) * solid_density + final_porosity * water_density # (kg/m^3)
## final_mass_fraction_bound_water = (1 - final_porosity) * solid_density / ((1 - final_porosity) * solid_density + final_porosity * water_density)
## final_mass_fraction_free_water  = final_porosity * water_density / ((1 - final_porosity) * solid_density + final_porosity * water_density)
## total_water = final_wt_percent_water * final_mass_fraction_bound_water + final_mass_fraction_free_water
## total_water final_wt_percent_water * (1 - final_porosity) * solid_density / ((1 - final_porosity) * solid_density + final_porosity * water_density) + final_porosity * water_density / ((1 - final_porosity) * solid_density + final_porosity * water_density)
## In the above equations, all are known except for final_porosity. 
## SOLVE FOR: final_porosity
# final_porosity = solid_density * (total_water - final_wt_percent_water) / ( (total_water - final_wt_percent_water)*solid_density + (1 - total_water)*water_density )
#
## This results in a porosity that should be equal to 0.0326086956521739. The output for the porosity composition after the reactions
## is 0.03261, verifying that we are conserving the mass of water.
