Added: Options to add particles to cells during model runs using
a point density function or histogram based method to add particles
to regions of cells which are lacking in particles.
The point of the new particle addition method is to reduce imbalances in
the particle distribution which can result from randomly selecting locations
in which to add particles to cells.
