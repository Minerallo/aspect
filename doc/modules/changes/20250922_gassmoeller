Changed: ASPECT's radial gravity plugins used to live in the same
header and source files contrary to most of our other plugins, which
each have one file per plugin. These plugins have been split into
separate files. The old header file 'gravity_model/radial.h' is
now deprecated and will be removed in the future. In addition,
the 'radial earth-like' plugin, which was disabled a long time ago,
was finally removed from the code.
