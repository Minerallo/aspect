New: There is now a new type of boundary condition for the
temperature equation: Robin boundary conditions, which allow
for prescribing a linear combination of a prescribed
temperature (Dirichlet) and a prescribed heat flux (Neumann).
In other words, we can now prescribe a heat flux that depends
on how much the current temperature differs from a prescribed
temperature.
