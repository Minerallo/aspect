# A model which utilizes the S20RTS temperature model within a 3D
# regional chunk with free slip boundary conditions on all sides.
# The output of this model is used to investigate the effect of boundary
# conditions on the regional model, and is compared with the output from
# `cookbooks/global_regional_coupling.prm`. Besides specifying a different
# geometry, this model is identical to `cookbooks/initial-condition-S20RTS.prm`.

# Include the S20RTS model from the initial condition cookbook, and change
# the output directory.
include $ASPECT_SOURCE_DIR/cookbooks/global_regional_coupling/free_slip_boundaries.prm

# For the regional calculation we do 5 global refinement steps, 3 more than the
# global S20RTS model in the `initial-condition-S20RTS` cookbook. This showcases
# how the 'extract_local_velocity' python script allows the user to interpolate
# coarser global models for higher resolution regional models.
