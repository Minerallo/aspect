# A model that utilizes the python script `contrib/python/scripts/extract_local_velocity.py`
# to take the output of the global convection cookbook `initial-condition-S20RTS`
# and apply the velocity as boundary conditions in a regional 3D spherical chunk.
# With the exception of the velocity boundary conditions and the geometry model, the
# .prm file for this cookbook is identical to the `initial-condition-S20RTS`
# cookbook .prm file.
