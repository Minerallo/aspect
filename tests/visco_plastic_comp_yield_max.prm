# This test checks that the compositionally dependent 
# maximum yield stress is causing the effective viscosity to change by 
# the correct amount. The velocity boundary conditions create a constant 
# applied strain rate 3.1709e-16 1/s (0.0005 m/y / 50e3 m / sec2yr). 
# The drucker prager parameters create a constant yield stress of 1e6 Pa, 
# which would give a viscosity of 1e6/2/3.17e-16 = 1.57e21 Pa s (this is the visco_plastic_yield test).
# In the visco_plastic_yield_max test, the maximum yield stress is limited to 0.5e6 Pa,
# reducing the effective viscosity to 0.5e6/2/3.17e-16 = 7.88e20. In this test, we have
# two compositions which divide the domain into halves: one which has a maximum yield stress that is 
# 0.5e6 Pa, and another which has a maximum yield stress that is 1e50. This results in a viscosity
# that is 7.88e20 Pa s in the left half of the domain and 1.57e21 Pa s in the right half.
